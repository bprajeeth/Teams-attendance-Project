# Microsoft Team's Attendance Calculator üßë‚Äçüíª

Team's attendance calculator is a **Desktop Application** that's an *easy-to-use attendance calculator that can be 
used with a click of a single button* that can save teachers loads of time 
and a log-book with precise and accurate details of attendance which has 
been compiled for many timestamps and stored in an excel file 
chronologically, to refer from. This is one among my project that creates a lot of impact both among the students and teachers.


# Faculty‚Äôs Note ‚úíÔ∏è

> I want to take the time to thank **Prajeeth** for the fantastic job. He did an excellent job by creating an **attendance App**. During this pandemic with all the new technology for teaching, teachers found it difficult to manage the students online. The App created by Prajeeth called **TEAMS ATTENDANCE CALCULATOR** has the following features:
> - Just one click on the downloaded attendance from team.
> - Sorting and giving attendance is done automatically by the App.
> - Each day attendance is updated in an excel sheet.
> - It gives attendance to those students who attend at least for a stipulated time set by the teachers. This makes a huge difference in the students to stay fully for the one-hour class.
> Keep it up **Prajeeth**, I appreciate your thought to create this App. Also, I am really thankful for your efforts to make this work.
Thank you once again!

>> With deep appreciation for your efforts, <br>
